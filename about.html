            <h1>About Ethiopian NGO Digital Donations</h1>
            <p>
                Many Ethiopian NGOs, like Macedonia, face challenges collecting digital donations
                due to security concerns and accessibility barriers, often relying on cash or insecure
                third-party tools. Our platform is designed to build trust, ensure security, and provide
                localized accessibility for all donors and organizations.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verified NGO profiles with real stories and photos, shared with consent, so donors see exactly who they are helping.</li>
                <li>Blockchain-powered public ledger logs every donation and its impact (e.g., “Donation A purchased ‘this’ for Child B”).</li>
                <li>Multi-language support (Amharic & Oromo) for wider accessibility.</li>
                <li>Integration with Tele birr/CBE and SMS OTP for secure, fraud-free donations.</li>
                <li>Automated donation process to help NGOs reach and support more people in need.</li>
            </ul>
